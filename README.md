[You Don't Know JS](https://github.com/getify/You-Dont-Know-JS)

### Data Structures and Algorithms and Generic Programming

[Cracking the Coding Interview](https://www.amazon.com/Cracking-Coding-Interview-Programming-Questions/dp/0984782850)

You will probably be sleeping with this book alongside your bed because it's basically the bible for algorithm styled tech interviews.

[Daily Coding Problem](https://www.amazon.com/Daily-Coding-Problem-exceptionally-interviews/dp/1793296634/)

A nice complement to Cracking the Coding Interview

[Introduction to Algorithms](https://www.amazon.com/Introduction-Algorithms-3rd-MIT-Press/dp/0262033844)

## Articles/Videos/Visualizations

### JavaScript

[The Completely JavaScript Handbook](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/the-complete-javascript-handbook-f26b2c71719c)

More a book than an article but it is published on FreeCodeCamp's Medium channel. But this is a fantastic read on all the fundamentals of JavaScript.

### React

[The React Handbook](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/the-react-handbook-b71c27b0a795)

More book than article, it is published on the FreeCodeCamp Medium. A very well published guide on React.

[Everything You Should Know About React: The Basics You Need to Start Building](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/everything-you-need-to-know-about-react-eaedf53238c4)

If you're trying to get a re-intro, this is a good article.

[React Lifecycle Method Diagram](http://projects.wojtekmaj.pl/react-lifecycle-methods-diagram/)

[React 16 Lifecycle Methods: How and When to Use Them](https://blog.bitsrc.io/react-16-lifecycle-methods-how-and-when-to-use-them-f4ad31fb2282)

Pretty much exactly as it says. A really nice resource. 

[Understanding React v16.4+ New Lifecycle Methods](https://blog.bitsrc.io/understanding-react-v16-4-new-component-lifecycle-methods-fa7b224efd7d)

An extension to the one above.

[The (new) React Lifecycle Methods in Plain, Approachable Language](https://blog.logrocket.com/the-new-react-lifecycle-methods-in-plain-approachable-language-61a2105859f3)

A longer read but still a great article.

[Deep Dive into the React Lifecycle Methods](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PpEQMdBIF0)

A good video that is around 30 minutes long to describe the React Lifecycle Methods

[React 16 for Everyone #6 - Lifecycle Methods](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9kSXwj_K-6o)

A more bit sized video at around 12 minutes long.

[Getting Started with React-Redux](https://hackernoon.com/getting-started-with-react-redux-1baae4dcb99b)

[The Complete Guide to Forms in React](https://medium.com/@agoiabeladeyemi/the-complete-guide-to-forms-in-react-d2ba93f32825)




### Node

[What the Heck is Event Loop Anyway?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aGhZQkoFbQ)

An excellent talk about how the event loop works in JavaScript. I'd argue probably one of the only talks you'd need to understand asynchronicity in JavaScript.

[The Definitive Node.js Handbook](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/the-definitive-node-js-handbook-6912378afc6e)

Again, same idea as the handbooks above: more book than article but fantastic nonetheless.


### Data Structures and Algorithms

[10 Common Data Structures Explained with Videos + Exercises](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/10-common-data-structures-explained-with-videos-exercises-aaff6c06fb2b)

If you're a visual learner, then this article is definitely for you. 

### Redux 

[When Do I Know I'm Ready For Redux?](https://medium.com/dailyjs/when-do-i-know-im-ready-for-redux-f34da253c85f)

An excellent article on when you should start thinking about Redux, how it works, and a scenario that popped up for the author on when they started using Redux.

[Three Principles](https://redux.js.org/introduction/three-principles)

This is from the Redux Docs itself and is probably one of the most important things to keep going back to.

[Leveling Up with React: Redux](https://css-tricks.com/learning-react-redux/)

Part of a three part series with this one being about how to manage state. It has a lot of good diagrams and is worth the read. 

[Redux Tutorial #1 - Reactjs Tutorial - How Redux Works](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w-oQ-i1XB8)

A bit sized video on how Redux works at around 7 minutes long.
